  <p class="alt-lede">The Shared Homeland Paradigm is a &#163;1 million UKRI-ESRC research project developed with A Land for All (ALFA), a joint Palestinian-Israeli movement. The project reimagines space, rights, and partnerships in Palestine-Israel.</p>

  <p>The Shared Homeland Paradigm: Reimagining Space, Rights and Partnerships in Palestine-Israel is a &#163;1 million &#8220;responsive mode&#8221; grant from UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) that pursue in collaboration with A Land for All (ALFA), a political initiative advocating a vision of &#8220;two states, one homeland,&#8221; and one of the few popular movements in Palestine-Israel whose leadership and members are drawn from across both nations.</p>

  <p>The project aims to develop a new conceptual basis for configuring space and rights in Palestine-Israel and build practical scenarios that chart a path from the current &#8220;one-state reality&#8221; to a two-state confederation built upon the values of equality, mutual self-determination, liberty of movement, and genuine interethnic partnership.</p>

  <p>The program of research, scenario development, and civil society engagement contributes to the conceptual clarity and policy depth to the platform of ALFA, by elaborating the shared homeland paradigm at the center of ALFA's vision. More broadly, our project offers a bridge for the international diplomatic community from the moribund concept of a two-state solution it has championed for several decades to one capable of realization and grounded in values worthy of support.</p>

  <p>The Shared Homeland Paradigm, Reimagining Space, Rights and Partnerships in Palestine-Israel is designed both to develop the shared homeland paradigm and to help bring it within mainstream discourse among the public in Palestine-Israel and influential policy communities elsewhere. We situate the paradigm in relation to relevant theoretical and discursive frameworks, preparing background papers that survey and analyse relevant comparative experience and introducing a lexicon that charts the meaning of related terms and proposes a vocabulary for elaborating the concept of partnership.</p>

  <h2>Research themes and methodology</h2>

  <p>We develop scenarios that explore the practical application of the paradigm about defined clusters of issues crucial to its viability, specifically: citizenship, residency, mobility; management of urban spaces; and environmental cooperation—drawing both on comparative experience and on field research in Palestine-Israel.</p>

  <p>We develop scenarios that explore the practical application of the shared homeland paradigm across citizenship, mobility, urban space management, and environmental cooperation.</p>

  <p>In addition, through our collaboration with ALFA, we convene live events and focus groups and create a Web-based platform to permit ongoing engagement with Israeli and Palestinian civil society, facilitating broad participation in the production of knowledge, critical appraisal of scenarios, and dissemination of analysis.</p>

  <h2>Context and significance</h2>

  <p>As the world marks the thirtieth anniversary of the Oslo Accords, the prospects for a two-state solution based on separation appear remote, and alternatives are garnering increasing attention from scholars, policy analysts, and diplomats. The idea of a Palestinian- Israeli confederation has elicited particularly substantial interest. However, research to date has tended to be under-theorized, lacking in practical detail, and/or remote from the public's eye. This project helps to address all three of these shortcomings and it works through the practical contours of the shared homeland paradigm in far greater depth than existing research, helping to rekindle political imagination among Palestinians and Israelis.</p>

  <h2>Contribution to knowledge</h2>

  <p>In addition, the project contributes to several fields of knowledge, exploring a novel approach to the design of norms, institutions, and geographic space in a deeply divided country, while at the same time modeling an approach to the co-production of knowledge that is consistent with the vision of partnership we envisage for Palestine-Israel.</p>
