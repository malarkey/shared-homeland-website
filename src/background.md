By the late nineteenth century, the region known as Palestine (then part of the Ottoman Empire) was home predominantly to Arab Muslim communities, with smaller numbers of Arab Christians and Jews. During the same period, the Zionist movement emerged in Europe: Jews, facing antisemitism and seeking national self-determination, argued for a return to a Jewish homeland in what they regarded as the Land of Israel. The Ottoman authorities and local Arab populations both anticipated problems from the growing immigrant Jewish population and land purchases.

Then came World War I and the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. Britain took control of what became known as the British Mandate for Palestine. In 1917 the British government issued the Balfour Declaration, which pledged support for a “national home for the Jewish people” in Palestine — while also stating that “nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine.” Over the next decades, increased Jewish immigration (especially fleeing Europe in the 1930s and post-Holocaust) changed the demographics and intensities of tensions in the territory.

These conditions produced inter-communal violence between Jewish and Arab communities during the Mandate period. By the late 1930s, the Arab Palestinian population launched a revolt against British rule and Zionist immigration — signalling that the Arab community rejected the terms being moulded around them.

Fast-forward to 1947: the United Nations Partition Plan (Resolution 181) proposed that the British Mandate territory be partitioned into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem under international control. Arab leaders and Palestinian Arabs rejected the plan; Jewish leadership accepted it with reservations. On 14 May 1948, the State of Israel declared independence. Within hours, armies from neighbouring Arab states (Egypt, Transjordan/Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq) entered the former Mandate territory. That conflict is known as the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.

The outcome of the 1948 war set many of the enduring fault-lines. Israel held more territory than the original UN partition plan had allotted; roughly 750,000 Palestinian Arabs fled or were expelled from their homes in what Palestinians call the Nakba (“catastrophe”). Jordan took control of the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) and Egypt controlled the Gaza Strip. No independent Palestinian state emerged. The question of refugees and their right of return became central in the Palestinian narrative.

In the decades that followed, the conflict shifted shape but remained unresolved. In 1967 the Six‑Day War saw Israel capture the West Bank (including East Jerusalem), the Gaza Strip, the Golan Heights, and the Sinai Peninsula (later returned to Egypt). This intensified the occupation question.  For Palestinians, the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza became the immediate reality. For Israel, issues of security, borders, and demographic concerns (in controlling large Palestinian populations) became more acute.

By the late twentieth century, the Palestinian national movement had coalesced around the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and a two-state solution was increasingly discussed internationally. The 1990s saw the Oslo Accords which offered a framework of Palestinian self-governance in parts of the West Bank and Gaza under Israeli security control.  However the process stalled, violence erupted (the First Intifada in 1987, the Second in 2000), settlement expansion continued, and trust eroded.

One must stress that the conflict is not simply territorial or national — it also involves identity, memory, religion and narrative. Jerusalem is sacred to Jews, Muslims and Christians; displacement of Palestinians remains deeply felt; Israeli security concerns are rooted in historical trauma, including the Holocaust; Palestinian rights to self-determination and statehood remain central demands. These overlapping layers make the conflict deeply resistant to simple solutions.

In recent years the focus has shifted to the specific issues of occupation, settlements, borders, Jerusalem, refugees, security and governance. Israel continues to control large parts of the West Bank, and the status of settlements and military control remains disputed in international law. Gaza has been under the control of Hamas since 2007, and it remains blockaded by Israel and Egypt — leading to repeated wars and humanitarian crises.
