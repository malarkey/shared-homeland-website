She provides strategic leadership for the Centre and represents it as an ambassador of pluralism to develop strong relationships with community leaders, governments, civil society and other institutions. Prior to joining the Centre in October 2019, Meredith devoted more than 20 years to addressing conflict and instability in Africa and Asia. From working with the Naga in Northeast India and Indigenous communities on the Thai-Myanmar border, to supporting UN efforts in Kosovo, Northern Iraq and several African countries, her work has straddled frontline mediation, policy and diplomacy.

As Africa Regional Director with the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue, Meredith oversaw the HD Centre’s complex mediation and dialogue efforts in Nigeria, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Sudan, Somalia and South Sudan, among other places. In the Kenyan National Dialogue and Reconciliation Process in 2007-08, she advised the Panel of Eminent African Personalities led by the late Kofi Annan, former Director of the Board of the Global Centre for Pluralism.

She has held positions with the United Nations in Sudan and South Sudan, and worked across the region on conflict resolution and humanitarian response efforts. Meredith began her career supporting conflict resolution efforts of Naga leaders in North East India and among Indigenous minorities in Myanmar with the Asia Indigenous Peoples Pact. She continues to contribute to policy discussions on peacemaking globally, including teaching peace process design and speaking on pluralism and the power of peacemaking, as highlighted in her recent TEDx Talk.
