From 2014 to 2017, she served as head of the University’s Department of Architecture. Professor Pullan’s research explores European and Middle Eastern architecture and cities, examining the processes of urban heritage, conflict, reconstruction and change – both historical and contemporary. Recent publications include: ‘Justice as the Urban Everyday’ (2019), ‘The disingenuous ‘clean-slate’: key concerns for reconstructing Ukraine’ (2024), ‘War by other means: Reconstruction in Syria’ (forthcoming 2025).

She has provided advisory and presentation work on issues related to divided cities and urban reconstruction in the Middle East for organisations such as Chatham House, the UN, ICOMOS, the RIBA and various NGOs and is presently co-chair of judging for Tamayouz. Her current work includes a book on the nature of urban conflict. She is a Fellow of Clare College, Cambridge.
