  <p><a href="https://www.2s1h.org/en" target="_blank">A Land for All</a> is a joint Israeli-Palestinian political initiative rooted in the lived reality of this land. It was founded by people who know the conflict not from headlines but from daily life. Together, they have dared to imagine a different future and have crafted a shared political vision grounded in dignity, equality, and belonging for both peoples.</p>
