title: The Shared Homeland Paradigm

main: |
 <p>Reimagining Space, Rights and Partnerships in Palestine-Israel is a £1 million &#8220;responsive mode&#8221; grant from UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) that pursue in collaboration with A Land for All, a political initiative advocating a vision of &#8220;two states, one homeland,&#8221; and one of the few popular movements in Palestine-Israel whose leadership and members are drawn from across both nations.</p>

 <p>The project aims to develop a new conceptual basis for configuring space and rights in Palestine-Israel and build practical scenarios that chart a path from the current &#8220;one-state reality&#8221; to a two-state confederation built upon the values of equality, mutual self-determination, liberty of movement, and genuine partnership.</p>

 <p>The program of research, scenario development, and civil society engagement contributes to the conceptual clarity and policy depth to the platform of ALFA, by elaborating the shared homeland paradigm at the center of ALFA&#8217;s vision.</p>

 <p>Our project offers a bridge for the international diplomatic community from the moribund concept of a two-state solution to one capable of realisation and grounded in values worthy of support.</p>
