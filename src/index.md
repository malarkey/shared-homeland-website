title: The Shared Homeland Paradigm

main: |
 <p>Reimagining Space, Rights and Partnerships in Palestine-Israel is a £1 million &#8220;responsive mode&#8221; grant from UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) that pursue in collaboration with A Land for All, a political initiative advocating a vision of &#8220;two states, one homeland,&#8221; and one of the few popular movements in Palestine-Israel whose leadership and members are drawn from across both nations.</p>

 <p>The project aims to develop a new conceptual basis for configuring space and rights in Palestine-Israel and build practical scenarios that chart a path from the current &#8220;one-state reality&#8221; to a two-state confederation built upon the values of equality, mutual self-determination, liberty of movement, and genuine partnership.</p>

aside: |
 <p>Our project offers a bridge for the international diplomatic community from the moribund concept of a two-state solution to one capable of realisation and grounded in values worthy of support.</p>
