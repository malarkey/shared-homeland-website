  <p>A core goal of The Shared Homeland Paradigm project is to rethink the language we use when discussing Palestine-Israel and to stimulate political imagination for future scenarios and possibilities. To achieve this, we are developing the Alternative Lexicon, which is designed to explore how terms’ meaning or value might fundamentally shift when examined through the lens of a Shared Homeland Paradigm, rather than one of ethnic separation.</p>

  <p>This Alternative Lexicon is intended to inform not only the project’s scenario-development process but also contribute to a broader discourse about potential political models for Palestine-Israel’s future.</p>

  <h3>Contribute to the Lexicon</h3>

  <p>We invite authors from diverse disciplines (law, social science, planning, environment, literature, art and more), different backgrounds (academics as well as activists and policy makers), diverse geographies, early career researchers as well as more established scholars, to develop a term for the Alternative Lexicon in one-day workshops in various locations. If you are interested in hosting and/or participating in an Alternative Lexicon workshop, please <a href="mailto:alternativelexicon@gmail.com">email us</a>.</p>
