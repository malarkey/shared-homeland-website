The term Israeli occupation describes Israel’s ongoing control of territories captured during the 1967 Six-Day War, including the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Although Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005, it continues to control Gaza’s borders, airspace, and sea access, leading many to argue that the occupation effectively persists there too.

Under international law, these areas are considered occupied territories, and the Palestinian population within them lives under military administration rather than full civil rights. The occupation has led to the construction of Israeli settlements, checkpoints, and separation barriers that fragment Palestinian communities and restrict movement. These measures have been widely criticised for undermining the possibility of a contiguous Palestinian state and violating human rights.

Supporters of Israeli policy argue that the occupation provides security against threats from militant groups and that territorial concessions must depend on guarantees of peace. Critics counter that prolonged occupation entrenches inequality and fuels instability across the region.

After nearly six decades, the Israeli occupation remains one of the most enduring and contentious political realities in the Middle East. It continues to shape daily life for millions of Palestinians and remains central to any discussion of peace and justice in the region.
