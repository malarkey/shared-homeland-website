Israeli settlements refer to civilian communities established by Israel in territories captured during the 1967 Six-Day War, primarily the West Bank and East Jerusalem. These areas are regarded by most of the international community as occupied territories, and the construction of settlements there is considered a violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention, which prohibits an occupying power from transferring its population into occupied land.

Despite this, settlement expansion has continued for decades, supported by government incentives such as housing subsidies and infrastructure development. Settlements range from small outposts to large towns with tens of thousands of residents, often built on land claimed by Palestinians for a future state. Their presence fragments the West Bank, divides Palestinian communities, and complicates the establishment of a viable, contiguous Palestinian territory.

Successive Israeli governments have defended settlements on historical, religious, and security grounds, while critics see them as an intentional effort to cement control and prevent a two-state solution. The expansion of settlements continues to provoke international condemnation and remains one of the most contentious issues in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. For Palestinians, they symbolise the daily reality of dispossession and the ongoing denial of self-determination and sovereignty.
