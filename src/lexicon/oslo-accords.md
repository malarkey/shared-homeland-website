The Oslo Accords were a series of agreements signed between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in the 1990s, beginning with the first accord in 1993. Negotiated secretly in Norway, the accords marked the first formal, direct recognition between the two sides: Israel recognised the PLO as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, and the PLO recognised Israel’s right to exist in peace and security.

The agreements established a framework for limited Palestinian self-government in parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip through the creation of the Palestinian Authority (PA). They also set out a process for further negotiations on key “final status” issues, including borders, refugees, security, and the status of Jerusalem—matters that were meant to be resolved within five years.

Although Oslo initially raised hopes for a lasting peace, the process faltered amid continued violence, mutual distrust, and expanding Israeli settlements. Many Palestinians came to view the accords as entrenching, rather than ending, the occupation, while many Israelis saw them as compromising security without delivering peace.

Three decades later, the Oslo framework remains a reference point for diplomacy, but its promise of a two-state solution has yet to be realised.
