The Palestine region is a geographic and cultural area located between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River. Historically known as a crossroads of civilisations, it has been home to diverse peoples and faiths for thousands of years. The name “Palestine” has referred to different territories over time, from ancient provinces under empires to the British Mandate of Palestine established after World War I.

Following the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the territory was divided: the new State of Israel was established on most of the land, while the West Bank came under Jordanian control and Gaza under Egyptian administration. In 1967, Israel captured both the West Bank and Gaza during the Six-Day War, beginning a military occupation that continues to shape the region’s politics and daily life.

Today, the term “Palestine” is used both geographically and politically. It refers to the occupied Palestinian territories—the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip—where Palestinians seek to establish an independent state. Despite decades of diplomacy and intermittent conflict, the boundaries and status of Palestine remain unresolved. The region continues to be a focal point of global attention, symbolising both deep historical roots and ongoing struggles for self-determination and peace.
