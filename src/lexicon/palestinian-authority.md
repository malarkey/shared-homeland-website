The Palestinian Authority (PA) was created in 1994 following the Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). It was intended as an interim self-governing body responsible for administering parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip until a final peace settlement could be achieved.

The PA is led by a president and government based in Ramallah, with limited powers over civil affairs, education, healthcare, and security in areas designated under partial Palestinian control (known as Areas A and B). Israel retains full authority over borders, airspace, and most of the West Bank’s land area, limiting the PA’s autonomy.

In 2007, a political split between the two major Palestinian factions—Fatah, which dominates the PA, and Hamas, which took control of Gaza—further weakened its authority. Since then, the PA has governed only parts of the West Bank, while Gaza has been ruled separately.

Despite its role in providing essential services and maintaining order, the PA faces widespread criticism from Palestinians for corruption, limited democratic accountability, and cooperation with Israeli security forces. Internationally, it is viewed as a key but fragile institution—central to any future negotiations toward Palestinian statehood and a lasting peace.
