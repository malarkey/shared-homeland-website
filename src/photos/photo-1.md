Ma'alul, The Catholic Church of Ma'alul—and together with a Greek Orthodox Church and a mosque—is what remains of the ancient Arab village of Ma'alul, just a few kilometers west of Nazareth. It was formed mainly by Christian Palestinians until 1948 when it was destroyed during the 1947–1949 Palestine war.
