This picture, believed to be taken in the late 1920s, shows Palestinian Shukri Al-Jamal and his wife, sisters and daughters in front of their home in the Talbiya neighborhood of Jerusalem. Today, Israelis live in the same property. Talbiya, officially called Komemiyut under the Israeli government, was built in the 1920s on land purchased from the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem. Most of the early residents were affluent Middle Eastern Christians who built elegant homes.
