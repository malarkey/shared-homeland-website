title: Reimagining Shared Space

<p>For decades, conversations about Israel and Palestine have revolved around lines—lines on maps, lines of control, and lines that divide people from one another.

The land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea is deeply intertwined—geographically, economically, and emotionally. Communities overlap; histories collide; infrastructure, water, and air are shared whether acknowledged or not. Recognising this interdependence doesn’t ignore national identities; it honours the reality that peoples are already living in one space.</p>
