  In certain cases, Quick Draw would also assume the identity of the Spanish masked vigilante El Kabong (a spoof of Zorro). His introduction went as follows—“Of all the heroes in legend and song, there’s none as brave as El Kabong.”

<p>He is an anthropomorphic white horse wearing a red Stetson cowboy hat, a red holster belt, a light blue bandana, and occasionally spurs, he was originally voiced mainly by Daws Butler from 1959 until Butler&#8217;s death in 1988. All 45 of his cartoons that originally aired between 1959 and 1961 were written by Michael Maltese, known best for his work at the Warner Bros. cartoon studio. The cartoon was nominated for an Emmy Award in 1960.</p>

 <p>Quick Draw was usually depicted as a sheriff in a series of short films set in the Old West. Quick Draw was often accompanied by his deputy, a Mexican burro called Baba Looey (also voiced by Daws Butler), who spoke with a Mexican accent and called his partner &#8220;Queeks Draw.&#8221; In the Spanish American version, Quick Draw is named Tiro Loco McGraw, while Baba Looey is named Pepe Trueno. In the Brazilian version, Quick Draw speaks in a Portuguese accent, which along with his Hispanized name (Pepe Legal) would suggest he was either a Texan-American or Mexican cowboy.</p>
