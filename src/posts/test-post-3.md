<p>For decades, conversations about Israel and Palestine have revolved around lines—lines on maps, lines of control, and lines that divide people from one another. Yet these lines, rather than resolving conflict, have often deepened it. Reimagining Shared Space begins with a simple question: what if instead of drawing new borders, we rethought what borders mean?</p>

<p>The traditional “two-state” approach envisions separation as the path to peace: one side here, the other there. But separation has proven hard to achieve and harder still to maintain. The land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea is deeply intertwined—geographically, economically, and emotionally. Communities overlap; histories collide; infrastructure, water, and air are shared whether acknowledged or not. Recognising this interdependence doesn’t ignore national identities; it honours the reality that peoples are already living in one space.</p>
