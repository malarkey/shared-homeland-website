His current research focuses on multiple dimensions of constitutional design in deeply divided and post-conflict societies, exploring constitutional systems predicated on power-sharing and consociational arrangements, including the design and function of Apex/Constitutional Courts, the governance implications of different post-conflict arrangements (namely federalism and consociationalism) and, more generally, constitutionalist conceptions undergirding post-conflict arrangements.
