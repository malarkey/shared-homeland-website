In 1997, he graduated the M.Sc. in Housing in Development with an overall distinction and with the support of the British Council Chevening Award. Between 2006–2007 he was a Fulbright Post-doctorate fellow at the Center for Middle Eastern Studies, University of California, Berkeley, and then joined the Department of Politics and Government at BGU. For the years 2010-2012 he received a Marie Curie Grant which has enabled him to work at Cambridge University, where he conducted a research project that dealt with contested cities. The main issues that stand in the core of his current research interest are the politics of cities, social justice, urban health, and (post)colonial planning. In 1999 he formulated the idea of establishing “Bimkom—Planners for Planning Rights” and NGO that deals with human rights and planning in Israel/Palestine and was its co-founder.
